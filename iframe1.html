  <h1>The Name Mohawk College</h1>

<p>The Board of Governors held its inaugural meeting on September 28, 1966 at which time the name of the College was discussed. For many years, there had been a strong desire to have a college in the City of Brantford. The Government decided that Hamilton was a more appropriate location and the College now serves the Golden Horseshoe, with campuses in Brantford, Stoney Creek, and Hamilton.

Choosing a name to reflect the wider community was a highly delicate matter in 1966. At the time, there seemed to be a preference for Aboriginal names. Joseph Brant, Chief of the Mohawks, had played a prodigious role in the former British Colony, winning respect for himself and his people. Note was made of the fact that the Mohawk Trail School, not far from the site of the College, was being turned into a museum for the celebration of the Canadian Centennial. The name "Mohawk" was comfortable for both Hamilton and Brantford. Thus the name Mohawk College of Applied Arts and Technology was agreed upon as reflecting the special nature of a large area of Brant county, including the Six Nations and New Credit Reservations, the City of Brantford, part of the adjacent region of Haldimand-Norfolk, and the County of Wentworth. Approval for the name was given by the Board on October 17, 1966.</p><br><br>
 
<h1>The Coat of Arms and Colours</h1>

<p>Many Heraldic symbols have a kind of iconograph of the name incorporated in their design. Several board members offered suggestions and as one of them remembered, attention focused on a stuffed hawk in one of the display cases. It was decided to feature the "hawk" section of "Mohawk". After consultation with the Royal College of Heraldry in England, a proposed Coat of Arms was approved at the June 18, 1969 Board meeting along with the college colours of red, black and gold. The hawk remains a symbol of Mohawk today, and the vision of the hawk is celebrated as part of the Mohawk character.</p>
